Culto is our final project, an E-Commerce website which is built from scratch as the final work of the Coding Bootcamp and carried out by Hack Academy. The project is divided into three parts:

- The first one is a public interface where users can navigate search and add products to a cart. It is not a requirement to be logged until you proceed to checkout. The user can add later its personal information to buy a product and check his/her previous orders.
- The second part of this project includes an administrator panel. The Admin has permissions to read, add, update and delete products, categories, and users.
- The third part consist in a REST API.

The process consisted of 3 work weeks that includes approximately 450 man hours. We used the agile methodology, testing the application and modifying our goals based on the data collected.
